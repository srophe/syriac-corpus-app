                    <h2>About the Digital Syriac Corpus</h2>
                    <p class="indent">The Digital Syriac Corpus is a freely available, open-access,
                        online repository for digitized editions of Syriac texts. All of the texts
                        in the Digital Syriac Corpus have been converted into TEI/XML formatting for
                        display and robust searching.</p>
                    <h2>Objectives for the Digital Syriac Corpus</h2>
                    <h3>Access</h3>
                    <p class="indent">Many Syriac texts are available only in manuscripts or in
                        print editions that are held only by top-tier research libraries. As such,
                        these texts are often inaccessible to both scholars and members of Syriac
                        heritage communities. We hope that this project will help improve access to
                        these texts worldwide.</p>
                    <h3>Preservation</h3>
                    <p class="indent">In addition to the preservation work being done by libraries
                        and archivists in libraries around the world to protect the physical
                        manuscripts containing these texts, we hope that the Digital Syriac Corpus
                        will serve as a digital repository for the preservation of Syriac texts for
                        future generations. Moreover, we hope that this archive of texts will become
                        a resource for the preservation of the Syriac language among heritage
                        communities around the world.</p>
                    <h3>Data Sharing</h3>
                    <p class="indent">All texts in the Digital Syriac Corpus are released under a
                        under a <a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/">Creative
                            Commons Attribution 4.0 International Public License (CC-BY 4.0)</a>.
                        The TEI/XML encoded documents are all available on GitHub, and we welcome
                        other scholars to use our data for new projects. The Digital Syriac Corpus
                        currently shares data (following the Linked Open Data model) with
                        Syriaca.org, especially the <a
