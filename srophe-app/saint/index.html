                <i>Gateway to the Syriac Saints</i> is a two volume electronic publication which aims to advance the study of the saints in the Syriac tradition. <i>Gateway to the Syriac Saints</i> includes entries on saints indigenous to the Syriac tradition and also on saints from other linguistic regions (Greek, Latin, etc.) whose lives were translated into Syriac or whose cults diffused to Syriac-speaking areas.</p>
            <p>The West and East Syriac churches have an extensive collection of stories and homilies on the saints, and they are contained in different manuscript collections and editions throughout the world. <i>Gateway to the Syriac Saints</i> aims to make prosopographic and bibliographic information on both the saints themselves and on the literary and hagiographical traditions of the saints available to scholars and students.</p>
            <p>To this end, Syriaca.org is creating two databases: <i>Volume I: Tašeʿēyātāʾ</i> on the literary <i>vitae</i> of Syriac saints, and <i>Volume II: Qadishe</i> on the persons of the saints themselves.</p>

                    <i>Volume I: Tašeʿēyātāʾ</i> describes texts written about saints and includes information about different versions and data such as the title, prologue, and epilogue of the saint's life, along with the hagiographer.  The database notes if there are ancient or modern translations of the texts, the critical edition of the text, the MSS containing the Vita, and relevant secondary literature. This reference work is derived from the earlier <i>Biblioteca Hagiographica Syriaca Electronica</i> project that was created by Fr. Ugo Zanetti and Dr. Claude Detienne but never published.

                    <i>Volume II: Qadishe</i> contains information on persons relevant to the study of Syriac hagiography include the saints themselves (such as St. Simeon the Stylite) as well as their associates and the authors who narrated their lives or wrote homilies and hymns about them.  Persons in the database can be annotated with relationships to other people and texts, and link with other Syriaca.org resources, such as the descriptions of places, manuscripts, or bibliography items.  <i>Qadishe</i> is organized according to the name of the saint, in English, French, and Syriac. It lists known dates associated with the saint (birth, <i>floruit</i>, death).  It also lists relationships between the saint and other ancient persons.  Finally, it contains geographical information on locations associated with the saint (birthplace, floruit place, place of death, place of relics, place of veneration). <i>Qadishe</i> takes as its starting point the standard reference on Syriac saints, J.-M. Fiey's <i>Saints syriaques</i> (Princeton, 2004) but also cites other major references including the <i>BHO</i>, <i>GEDSH</i>, and the <i>BSO</i>.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>We anticipate that together these two volumes of the <i>Gateway to the Syriac Saints</i> will be a starting reference point both for Syriac specialists and students and scholars from ancillary disciplines.
