            <h2>Introduction:</h2>
            <p class="indent">by Nathan P. Gibson and David A. Michelson</p>
            <h3>Overview</h3>
            <p>
                <em>The New Handbook of Syriac Literature</em> is a reference guide to Syriac works,
                including their titles and other identifying information, as well as their
                manuscript witnesses, editions, and translations. Each entry describes a single
                Syriac work (or a part of a larger work in some cases) and provides a unique
                identifier for it in the form of a <a
                    href="http://syriaca.org/exist/apps/srophe/documentation/terms.html#uri"
                >URI</a>. The <em>NHSL</em> is designed to serve as a finding aid for researchers,
                an authority file for archivists, and a cyberinfrastructure for digital Syriac
                    projects.<span class="footnote-refs"><span class="footnote-ref">
                        <a href="#note1">1</a></span></span></p>
            <h3>Volumes</h3>
            <p>Volume 1, on hagiography,
                edited by Jeanne-Nicole Mellon Saint-Laurent, David A. Michelson, Ugo Zanetti and
                Claude Detienne, is titled <em>Bibliotheca Hagiographica Syriaca Electronica</em>
                and may be found at <a href="http://syriaca.org/bhse"
                    >http://syriaca.org/bhse</a>.<span class="footnote-refs"><span
                        class="footnote-ref">
                        <a href="#note2">2</a></span></span></p>
            <p>Additional volumes are in prepration.</p>
            <h3>Coverage</h3>
            <p>At present, the first volume of <em>The New Handbook of Syriac Literature</em> covers the genre of hagiography. The <em>Handbook</em> will be 
                expanded with future volumes to cover all genres of Syriac literature.</p>
                <p>The types of works represented in Syriac texts are multitude, ranging from tomb
                inscriptions of only a few words to voluminous world chronicles; from folk tales to
                scholarly treatises; and from routine letters and technical jurisprudence to lofty
                liturgical poetry.<span class="footnote-refs"><span class="footnote-ref">
                        <a href="#note3">3</a>
                    </span></span> Many of these works were originally composed in Syriac, but a
                good number were translated or adapted from texts in Greek or other languages. In
                fact, Syriac translators played a key role in the golden age of Arabic philosophy,
                which in turn was one of the crucial factors leading to the renewed interest in
                Greek philosophical works during the Italian Renaissance. As is apparent, Syriac
                literature has relevance for a wide variety of scholars, among them historians of
                many kinds, archaeologists, philosophers, and theologians. The breadth and depth of
                this set of texts crosses regional, chronological, and disciplinary boundaries.</p>
            <p>The goal of the <em>NHSL</em> is to eventually provide one entry for each Syriac
                work, from antiquity to the present, regardless of its literary form, genre, or
                provenance. By the term, "work," we mean "a distinct intellectual or artistic
                    creation,"<span class="footnote-refs"><span class="footnote-ref">
                        <a href="#note4">4</a>
                    </span></span> as opposed to an individual manuscript or text-bearing object.
                Thus, each manuscript may contain many works, and each work may be represented in
                multiple manuscripts.<span class="footnote-refs"><span class="footnote-ref">
                        <a href="#note5">5</a>
                    </span></span> Each entry in the <em>NHSL</em> is essentially a way of grouping
                information and resources tied together by an ideal or conceptual work, whether or
                not that work ever existed in a single given form historically. While the first
                edition is not intended to be comprehensive, either in the works that it covers or
                in the details it provides about them, it does rely on some of the most significant
                and widely used print and digital resources for Syriac literature, including Anton
                Baumstark's <em>Geschichte der syrischen Literatur mit Ausschluß der
                    christlich-palästinensischen Texte</em>, <a href="http://syriaca.org/mss"><em>A
                        Digital Catalogue of Syriac Manuscripts in the British Library</em></a>
                based on William Wright's catalogue, and cataloguing information from the <a
                    href="http://www.hmml.org/">Hill Museum &amp; Manuscript Library</a> and <a
                    href="http://mss-syriaques.org/">eKtobe</a>, among others. As such, the editors
                believe it provides the broadest and most usable reference tool for Syriac works to
                date.</p>

            <h3>Rationale</h3>
            <p>Syriac scholars have long relied primarily on two kinds of resources to discover and
                describe Syriac works: (1) literature histories and (2) manuscript catalogues. For
                most scholars who could not explore manuscript archives in person, these tools
                necessarily set the research agenda for editing, translating, and discussing texts.
                As Kristian Heal has observed, "The history of Syriac studies could well be told in
                terms of the scholars’ search for, or frustrated separation from, the books they
                wish to study."<span class="footnote-refs"><span class="footnote-ref">
                        <a href="#note6">6</a>
                    </span></span></p>
            <p>In recent years, scanned texts and digital manuscript catalogues have made Syriac
                literature more accessible than ever before. Nevertheless, one usually has to know
                the shelfmark or bibliographic details of a work for which one is searching, since
                these resources are spread across the web with no central hub and no uniform
                identifiers. Without optical character recognition (OCR) to make the text of Syriac
                editions searchable, one has to rely almost entirely on metadata (such as titles and
                author names), which is often very poor for scanned texts in particular. The lack of
                infrastructure means that discoverability and accessibility have continued to set
                research agendas and that it has so far been impossible to study characteristics or
                trends of the Syriac literary corpus as a whole.</p>
            <p>The current dearth of reference tools for discovering, identifying, classifying, and
                referencing Syriac works provides an unparalleled opportunity—using digital methods
                to "re-sort" and "re-orient" the available data in the field of Syriac
                    literature.<span class="footnote-refs"><span class="footnote-ref">
                        <a href="#note7">7</a>
                    </span></span> By including both edited and unedited works from a wide
                chronological range that are extant in manuscript repositories all over the globe,
                the <em>New Handbook of Syriac Literature</em> aims to begin enabling scholars to
                investigate research questions that encompass Syriac literature at its widest
                extent, whether these studies examine chronological trends, geographical patterns,
                literary form and genre, or other dimensions yet to be imagined.</p>

            <h3>Integration with Other Tools and Disciplines</h3>
            <p>The <em>NHSL</em> is tightly integrated with other Syriaca.org resources, including
                reference works relating to <a href="http://syriaca.org/mss">manuscripts</a>, <a
                    href="http://syriaca.org/authors">authors</a>, <a href="http://syriaca.org/q"
                    >saints</a>, and <a href="http://syriaca.org/geo">places</a>. The <em>NHSL</em>
                not only links to these entities throughout, but uses their URIs as identifiers,
                meaning, for example, that a search for works authored by Ephrem (<a
                    href="http://syriaca.org/person/13">http://syriaca.org/person/13</a>) does not
                rely on the spelling of the name "Ephrem" and distinguishes these works from those
                written by other authors with the name "Ephrem." The Relationships sidebar displays
                works' connections to other Syriaca.org resources. </p>
            <p>Syriac literature has close connections to the literature of many other languages,
                including Greek, Arabic, Ethiopic, Armenian, Georgian, and Coptic, among others. It
                also offers much to, and benefits greatly from, related fields such as classics,
                philosophy, and theology, to mention only a few. Thus, the <em>NHSL</em> editors
                actively seek to link to related projects and share data with them. The approach we
                have taken can generally be described as a <a
                    href="https://www.w3.org/DesignIssues/LinkedData.html">linked open data</a>
                approach, which makes it possible to dynamically identify related information and
                pull it from all across the web. The underlying data formats, <a
                    href="http://www.tei-c.org">TEI-XML</a> and <a
                    href="https://www.w3.org/2001/sw/wiki/RDF">RDF</a> are widely used open formats,
                and all <em>NHSL</em> data is licensed for sharing and reuse with attribution, under
                a <a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/">Creative Commons
                    Attribution 4.0 International</a> license. </p>
