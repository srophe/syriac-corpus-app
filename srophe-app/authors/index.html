            </h1>
            <h2>The Syriac Biographical Dictionary (SBD), Volume II</h2>
            <p>Editors: David A. Michelson and Nathan P. Gibson, Vanderbilt University</p>
            <h2>Introduction:</h2>
            <p class="indent">by David A. Michelson</p>
            <p>
                <em>A Guide to Syriac Authors</em> is a literary reference work documenting authors
                relevant to the study of Syriac literature. This guide is designed as an aid for
                both historical research and cataloguing. The entries in the guide are written to
                help researchers identify and disambiguate authors related to the history of Syriac
                literature. This author list can be browsed or searched based on numerous criteria
                including chronology, geography, and relationships between persons and texts. <em>A
                    Guide to Syriac Authors</em> is also designed to meet the pressing need for a
                name authority file for use by librarians in cataloguing Syriac manuscripts, texts,
                and published works.</p>
            <p>Each individual entry in <em>A Guide to Syriac Authors</em> corresponds to one person
                who can be identified as an author. These entries are also included in Syriaca.org's
                larger database of persons, <a href="../persons/index.html"><em>The Syriac
                        Biographical Dictionary (SBD)</em></a>, so that researchers interested in
                prosopography more broadly will have access to the same entries. The sole criteria
                for inclusion of a particular author in <em>A Guide to Syriac Authors</em> is
                relevance to the study of Syriac literature. "Relevant authors" include not only
                persons who wrote in the classical Syriac language or modern Neo-Aramaic dialects,
                but also a broader range of authors (ancient and modern) whose works have been
                translated into Syriac or otherwise influenced Syriac literature. For example,
                relevant entries have also been made for authors who did not write in Syriac but who
                are named or cited in Syriac texts. Entries have also been created for authors in
                dialogue with Syriac literature who wrote in the many languages neighboring the
                Syriac traditions (Arabic, Armenian, Malayalam, etc). There are no temporal or
                spatial boundaries for the database, which collects data on authors from any period
                past or present useful for Syriac studies, from authors credited in Syriac biblical
                translations to members of the contemporary diaspora communities. Similarly,
                historicity is not a selection criteria, thus <em>A Guide to Syriac Authors</em>
                includes entries on pseudonymous, uncertain, anonymous, or collective authors when
                they are of significance for research on Syriac culture. In all cases, inclusion of
                an author is based on the collection of sufficient citation information to uniquely
                distinguish each identity. All authors with entries in <em>A Guide to Syriac
                    Authors</em> can be annotated to show their relationships to persons, places, or
                other data published by Syriaca.org such as in <a href="../geo/index.html"><em>The
                        Syriac Gazetteer</em></a>.</p>
            <p>As a sub-collection within a larger reference work, <a href="../persons/index.html"
                        ><em>The Syriac Biographical Dictionary (SBD)</em></a>, <em>A Guide to
                    Syriac Authors</em> was designed with the same information structure. All
                entries must include at least one specific primary or secondary source citation
                sufficient to identify and disambiguate the person. Most entries also contain name
                variant information. When possible some entries contain greater biographical detail
                although such detail is not the foremost goal of the publication. The overarching
                purpose is to provide a unique identifier (a <a
                    href="http://syriaca.org/exist/apps/srophe/documentation/terms.html#uri"
                >URI</a>, uniform resource identifier) for each Syriac author to facilitate
                cataloguing of Syriac literary works and the creation of linked data in which author
                URIs will enable linking not only betweeen Syriaca.org's <em>Guide to Syriac
                    Authors</em> and its forthcoming <em>New Handbook of Syriac Literature</em> but
                also to external partner projects such as the manuscript catalogues of <a
                    href="www.mss-syriaques.org/">e-ktobe (Manuscrits syriaques)</a>, <a
                    href="www.hmml.org/">the Hill Museum and Manuscript Library</a>, and <a
                    href="http://www.bl.uk/collection-guides/christian-middle-east-collections">The
                    British Library</a>. These person URIs take the form
                    <code>http://syriaca.org/person/\d+</code> (where "\d+" indicates a unique
                string of one or more numerals). As an example,
                    <code>http://syriaca.org/person/13</code> represents the noted Syriac author and
                saint: <a href="http://syriaca.org/bibl/13">Ephrem the Syrian</a>.</p>
            <p>All entries from this reference work are encoded following the guidelines of the <a
                    href="http://www.tei-c.org/index.xml">Text Encoding Initiative (TEI)</a>, a best
                practice used widely in digital scholarship on literary corpora. In addition, the
                person records of <em>A Guide to Syriac Authors</em> are also serialized into other
                data formats for use by other projects. For example entries are exported as MADS
                records and included in OCLC’s <a
                    href="http://viaf.org/viaf/search?query=local.names+all+%22ephrem%22+and+local.sources+any+%22srp%22&amp;sortKeys=holdingscount"
