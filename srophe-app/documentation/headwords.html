            <p>The Syriaca.org headword is the name used by Syriaca.org for document titles, citation, and disambiguation. 
                While headwords are usually created from primary source citations, those without source attributes may not be 
                attested in extant sources. They are included only to aid the reader for the purpose of disambiguation.
            </p>
            <p>The headword is usually related to the Syriac name for the entity, although Syriac and Romanized headwords are not 
                necessary exactly parallel.  In certain cases, however, the English headword is not based on the Syriac form at all.
                When there is an English form that is more widely used, such as 
                <a href="http://syriaca.org/place/78">Edessa</a> instead of "Urhoy," that form is used.  When we have not found
                a Syriac form, such as for <a href="http://syriaca.org/place/206">Urmia</a>, the headword may be based on a 
                name in Greek, Arabic, or some other language.  Finally, Syriac names taken from <a href="http://syriaca.org/person/454">
                    Yuḥanon Dolabani's</a> Syriac <a href="http://syriaca.org/bibl/3">translation</a> of <a href="http://syriaca.org/person372">
                        Ignatius Afram Barsoum's</a> work <a href="http://syriaca.org/bibl/2">The Scattered Pearls</a> sometimes reflect
                a translation of the meaning of Barsoum's Arabic into Syriac, and it is unknown whether the Syriac word was ever
                used as a proper noun, for example the <a href="http://syriaca.org/place/517">Ghūṭa</a> around Damascus, which
                Dolabani labels ܥܒܐ ("forest").  The Arabic term was certainly used as a proper name, whereas it is unclear whether 
                the Syriac term was so used, and therefore the headword has been derived from the Arabic.
