                <i>The Syriac Gazetteer</i> refers to religious communities using a nested controlled vocabulary.  These terms are used according
                to scholarly convention and for scholars' convenience, without asserting that members of these groups would have called themselves by these labels.
                In this context, "religious communities" is not intended to imply a plurality of members in any one location, nor any harmonious existence
                among people identified with the same label.  Nor are the existence of multiple labels intended to suggest that these categories are immutable
                or mutually exclusive.  <i>Caveat lector.</i>
            </p>
            <p>NB: Each list is alphabetized within its level, with the exception of Syriac.</p>
