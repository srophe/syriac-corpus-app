                    <h2>Introduction: Syriac Hagiography</h2>
                    <p>
                        Hagiography is the genre of the lives of the saints (Hinterberger in Efthymiadis, 
                        
                        2014; Harvey 2008).  It emerged in the late antique period as a literary form to 
                        
                        commemorate Christians whose lives were seen and promoted as models of sanctity.  The 
                        
                        study of Syriac hagiography offers scholars an important window into the cultural and 
                        
                        religious history of the Middle East, and it brings together a wide array of literary forms, 
                        
                        including prose and poetry (Insley and Saint-Laurent, forthcoming 2017).  Broadly
                        
                        defined, Syriac hagiographic literature includes 1) apocryphal <em>Acts</em>, 2) metrical homilies 
                        
                        and liturgical hymns on saints, 3) extended <em>Lives</em> or <em>Vitae</em>, 4) shorter episodic vignettes, 
                        
                        sayings’ material, or miracle stories contained in larger collections, and 5) martyr 
                        
                        romances or passions.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The production of saints’ lives blossomed in late antiquity alongside the growth of 
                        
                        the cult of the saints.  Scholars have attended to hagiographic traditions in Greek and 
                        
                        Latin, but many scholars have yet to discover the richness of Syriac hagiographic 
                        
                        literature: the stories, homilies, and hymns on the saints that Christians of the Middle East 
                        
                        told and preserved.  It is our hope that our database will give scholars and students 
                        
                        increased access to these traditions to generate new scholarship. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Over 1,200 works of hagiographic literature are extant in the Syriac language.
                        
                        The corpus of Syriac hagiography comprises texts that were composed originally in 
                        
                        Syriac as well as translations from other languages of the late antique world like Greek 
                        
                        (Brock, 2008; Brakke, 1994; Draguet, 1980).  Syriac hagiography developed in the 
                        
                        context of the liturgy and alongside cults to local saints: vignettes of holy persons would 
                        
                        be read on their feast days (Taylor, 2012).
                        
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Syrian monks produced and translated many of the texts that survive.  An interest
                        
                        in monasticism and asceticism is an outstanding feature of Syriac hagiography.  Many 
                        
                        Syriac hagiographic texts honor monastic saints and connect theses heroes to the 
                        
                        foundations of particular monasteries (Debié, 2012).  The monasteries of Tur Abdin (a 
                        
                        region in South-east Turkey and center of the Syrian Orthodox world) produced 
                        
                        important hagiographic cycles on their founders (Palmer, 1990), and later hagiography
                        
                        that comes from this region also gives us important evidence about the encounters of
                        
                        Christians and Muslims in the early days of Islam (Tannous, 2012).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Syriac hagiography has a rich manuscript tradition with major collections now in
                        
                        Berlin, London, Paris, and the Vatican (Bingelli, 2012b). The oldest extant Christian 
                        
                        manuscript, BL Add. 12150, is dated to 411 CE and was produced in Edessa (Bingelli, 
                        
                        2012b; Wright, 1871, II).  It contains a list of names and dates for the commemoration of 
                        
                        western martyrs, together with a list of Persian martyrs and their feast days.

                    <p>
                        The critical study of Syriac hagiography began when Assemani published the
                        
                        <em>Acta Sanctorum Martyrum orientalium et occidentalium</em> in 1748, a collection of Syriac 
                        
                        hagiographic texts from the Vatican library (Bingelli, 2012a).  Paul Bedjan (d. 1920), a 
                        
                        Chaldean Catholic from Iran, later published a seven-volume series of saints’ lives in the 
                        
                        Syriac language: the <em>Acta Martyrum et sanctorum syriace</em> (AMS).  Through the efforts of 
                        
                        orientalists François Nau and E. W. Brooks, many Syriac saints’ lives were published in 
                        
                        <em>Patrologia Orientalis</em> and <em>Revue de l’Orient chrétien</em>.  The Bollandist Paul Peeters 
                        
                        produced the  <em>Bibliotheca hagiographica orientalis</em> (BHO), which contained an annotated 
                        
                        index of saints’ lives and manuscripts from the Oriental linguistic traditions.

                    <p>
                        J.-M. Fiey wrote an important guide to the Syriac saints, <em>Saints syriaques</em>, 
                        
                        published posthumously in 2004.  His book lists about 400 saints from the West and East 
                        
                        Syriac traditions, including modern saints.  <em>Saints syriaques</em> is organized according to 
                        
                        holy person rather than hagiographic text.  Fiey provides a brief description of each saint 
                        
                        along with pertinent primary and secondary material.  It is a natural starting point for 
                        
                        scholars interested in Syriac hagiography. Sergey Minov of Oxford/Hebrew University
                        
                        has also built an important on-line bibliography for Syriac studies,  <em>A Comprehensive 
                        
                        Bibliography on Syriac Christianity</em>, (<a href="http://www.csc.huji.ac.il">http://www.csc.huji.ac.il</a>)  (Minov, 2015).

                    <h2>Saints and their Lives in the Syriac Tradition</h2>
                    <p>
                        The majority of hagiographic materials are saints’ <em>Lives</em> and short episodic
                        
                        vignettes contained within larger hagiographic collections.  In 360, Athanasius of 
                        
                        Alexandria composed the first extended hagiographic narrative in Greek, <em>The Life of 
                        
                        Antony of Egypt</em>  (<em>βίος καὶ πολιτεἰα</em>; PG 26: 835-936).  This text became a ‘best-seller’ in 
                        
                        the late antique world, and its form was canonized as the literary exemplar for describing 
                        
                        the life of a saint. It was translated into several ancient languages including Syriac.  
                        
                        Subsequent late antique hagiographers imitated Athanasius’ narrative structure that 
                        
                        depicted 1) the saint’s childhood; 2) conversion; 3) asceticism; 4) miracles; 5) 
                        
                        extraordinary death; 6) communal commemoration (Insley and Saint-Laurent, 
                        
                        forthcoming 2017).

                    <p>
                        In the sixth century, Syriac-speaking Miaphysites (dissidents of the Council of 
                        
                        Chalcedon) composed hagiography on those who became leaders of the nascent Syrian 
                        
                        Orthodox church. One of the most important collections of Syriac hagiographic texts is 
                        
                        John of Ephesus’s <em>Lives of the Eastern Saints</em> (Brooks, 1923-25; Harvey, 1990; Saint-
                        
                        Laurent, 2015).  His stories commemorate ascetics who lived in northern Mesopotamia, 
                        
                        in monasteries near the city of Amida.<span class="footnote-refs">

                        </span>  John’s collection of hagiography is also an 
                        
                        important source for understanding the relationships between Chalcedonians and their 
                        
                        opponents.

                        Syriac martyr <em>passions</em> comprise another important part of the corpus of Syriac 
                        
                        hagiography.  These stories feature an account of the saint’s virtue, arrest, dialogue with a
                        
                        judge, torture, death, burial and distribution or enshrining of relics.  Examples of Syriac
                        
                        martyr passions include the <em>Life of Febronia of Nisibis</em> and the stories of the Edessan 
                        
                        martyrs.

                        The <em>Life of Febronia</em> (AMS V, 573-615; Brock and Harvey, 1998; Saint-Laurent,
                        
                        2012) is a hagiography that describes a monastic scholar, Febronia.  She lives in 
                        
                        community with her fellow nuns in the city of Nisibis (modern-day Nusaybin, Turkey).  
                        
                        Her beauty attracts the attention of Roman guards, who have come to persecute 
                        
                        Christians and convince them to sacrifice to the Roman gods.  Febronia refuses the sexual 
                        
                        advances of the Roman senators, and she is tortured and killed.  A cult to Febronia 
                        
                        develops and spreads from Nisibis to Constantinople and even to Sicily.  The city of 
                        
                        Edessa also promoted local martyr traditions around which cultic devotions grew.  These 
                        
                        Edessan martyr stories include the <em>Martyrdom of Shmona, Guria, and Habib</em> and the <em>Acts 
                        
                        of Sharbel, Babai, and Barsamya</em> (Burkitt, 1913; rep., 2007).  Syriac martyr passions 
                        
                        identified martyrdom as betrothal to Christ (Brock and Harvey, 9).

                        The Acts of the Persian martyrs is a vast body of largely understudied 
                        
                        hagiographic texts from the East Syriac tradition that flourished in modern-day Iran and 
                        
                        Iraq (Brock, 2009; Smith, 2014).  These texts are important literary artifacts from 
                        
                        Christians living under Sasanian rule. The account of the martyrdom of Simeon bar 
                        
                        Shabba, for example, is one of the longest late antique Christian narratives in any 
                        
                        language (Smith, 2014). More than the 2/3 of the Persian martyr acts were set in the reign 
                        
                        of Shah Shapur II (d. 379), remembered as a time of great trial and conflict (Smith, 
                        
                        2014).  Many of the Persian martyr texts, although set in the fourth century, were written 
                        
                        several centuries later.  The story of the <em>Martyrs of Mount Berʿain</em>, for example, was
                        
                        written in the seventh century, but situated 318/9, at the start of Shapur II’s reign (Smith,
                        
                        2014; Brock and Dilley, 2015). Some stories, although vital to East Syrian Christian 
                        
                        memory, might have been purely fictive (Smith, 2012), as is true of hagiographical 
                        
                        literature from other linguistic traditions.

                        Syrians wrote not just prose but also verse to commemorate saints.  There are two
                        
                        main categories of verse in Syriac literature: metrical verse homilies called <em>memre</em> 
                        
                        (<em>memra</em>, sing.) and liturgical hymns known as <em>madrashe</em> (<em>madrasha</em>, sing.). <em>Memre</em> and 
                        
                        <em>madrashe</em> on saints show how stories about saints were retold in new literary forms for 
                        
                        liturgical purposes.  They are important sources for the creation and diffusion of saints’ 
                        
                        portraits in Syriac religious memory.

                        Sebastian Brock wrote an important article in which he expounded on the various
                        
                        types of hagiographic <em>memre</em> in Syriac literature (Brock, 2012).   He explains that the 
                        
                        genre of Syriac hagiographic <em>memre</em> comprises several forms, ranging from verse 
                        
                        homilies rich in narrative details to those that are largely panegyric.  Often <em>memre</em> are 
                        
                        imaginative expansions (or exegeses) on earlier hagiographic texts (Brock, 2012).  Jacob 
                        
                        of Serugh, for example, composed a verse homily on the forty martyrs of Sebaste (AMS 
                        
                        VI, 663-673), and it is clear that he used a Syriac translation of the Greek hagiography on 
                        
                        these saints to compose his verse (Brock, 2012). Jacob also wrote hagiographic <em>memre</em> 
                        
                        with the characteristics of panegyric, as exemplified in his memra on Sts. Sergius and 
                        
                        Bacchus (AMS VI, 650-661) (Brock, 2012).  In these, the narrative element is not as 
                        
                        strong.  Instead, the homily contains general praise for the virtues of the saint or saints.  
                        
                        Other panegyric <em>memre</em> in Syriac borrow rhetorical elements and schema from the Greek 
                        
                        encomium (Brock, 2012).

                        <em>Madrashe</em>, in contrast to <em>memre</em>, are poetic hymns sung antiphonally in the 
                        
                        context of the Syriac liturgy.  Hagiographic <em>madrashe</em> are found in the West Syrian 
                        
                        (Syrian Orthodox or Maronite) <em>Fenquitho</em>, a collection hymns for Sundays and feast days 
                        
                        (Brock, 2012).   Ephrem the Syrian perfected the Syriac <em>madrashe</em>.  Many of Ephrem’s 
                        
                        <em>madrashe</em> commemorate saints, as demonstrated in his cycle of hymns known as the 
                        
                        <em>Hymns on Nisibis</em>.  This collection contains madrashe on Sts. Abraham Qidunaya and 
                        
                        Julian Saba (Griffith, 1994; Brock, 2012).

                    <p>
                        Syriac poets also composed a type of madrasha called the dialogue poem or
                        
                        sogita, which features disputes between characters, sometimes saints, who antiphonally 
                        
                        debate matters with each other. These debate poems show the intersection of hagiography 
                        
                        and exegesis.  Sebastian Brock edited and translated a sogita that featured a debate 
                        
                        between Saint Marina - an ascetic who lived in a monastery disguised as a male monk - 
                        
                        and Satan (Brock 2008a).  Many other such hagiographic dialogue poems have yet to be 
                        
                        published.

                        Syriac-speaking Christians shaped their hagiographic tales according to the
                        
                        models and ideals of holiness that were particular to their own anxieties, theological and 
                        
                        political values, and even geography.  Scholars of late antiquity can discover features and 
                        
                        idioms particular to Syriac hagiography through comparing Syriac sacred stories to their 
                        
                        counterparts from the Greek- and Latin-speaking worlds.  Much can be learned by 
                        
                        studying and contrasting different versions of a single saint’s life that circulated in 
                        
                        different eras.  Often, later versions of a saint’s life will reflect the community’s higher 
                        
                        elevation of the saint described in the text (Saint-Laurent, 2015).

                        Literary similarities among hagiographic texts are apparent even to a casual 
                        
                        reader.  Hagiographers imitated the motifs, themes, and narrative structure found in 
                        
                        biblical stories, other hagiographies, and even stories and myths from non-Christian 
                        
                        precedents (Greek, Latin, Mesopotamian, or Iranian).  The literary similitudes in tales 
                        
                        about monks, martyrs, or missionaries are not coincidental.  Rather, conventions for 
                        
                        depicting different types of saints and motifs for demonstrating their divine authority 
                        
                        were transmitted and canonized.  Hagiographers took these patterns and reshaped them 
                        
                        according to their individual interests, impressing their stories with the marks of their 
                        
                        own culture, community, and ideological agendas.  In this way, they crafted new stories 
                        
                        adorned with literary relics or <em>spolia</em> from earlier texts.

                        Late antique hagiography is also a fertile ground to study ancient translation 
                        
                        history and theory.  For instance, the Syriac version of Athanasius’s <em>Life of St. Antony</em> 
                        
                        shares many features with the Greek account, but the symbols of holiness that the story 
                        
                        used to describe St. Antony are distinctly Syrian.  Even if hagiographic tales contain little 
                        
                        historical data, they are nevertheless vital literary artifacts that speak of a semitic culture 
                        
                        at the crossroads between East and West, between Byzantium and Persia. The corpus of 
                        
                        Syriac hagiography, therefore, offers important insights into the literary and religious 
                        
                        history of Christianity in the Middle East.

                    <p>
                        At this juncture, it should be apparent that Syriac hagiography represents a dynamic 
                        
                        sub-field within late antique literature.  In the past twenty years, scholars have shown a 
                        
                        greater interest in producing critical editions and translations of Syriac hagiographic 
                        
                        texts, but many remain unknown or unavailable to non-specialists.  While print guides
                        
                        and bibliographies provide a starting point for study, they do not reveal connections and 
                        
                        relationships among saints and their lives.  It is our claim that digital tools can be an 
                        
                        immeasurable help in illuminating these links among texts, authors, and communities.

                        To meet this need, Syriaca.org has created a two-volume database entitled the 
                        
                        <em>Gateway to the Syriac Saints</em> on persons and hagiographic texts. Through linking data on 
                        
                        saints, hagiographers, and the locations and texts associated with them, our database can 
                        
                        generate new knowledge for scholars and show both the interconnected similarities as 
                        
                        well as the unique traits of these saints.  Each volume is organized around a different 
                        
                        element, either persons (saints) or works (texts about them).  Both volumes are also part 
                        
                        of larger databases within Syriaca.org on “Syriac Works” and “Syriac Persons,” 
                        
                        respectively.  We have not created two data models for each of these volumes, but rather 
                        
                        we are using two existing data models.  For works, we are using an adaptation by

                        be accessed by other databases and institutions.  We have used TEI for both our data and 
                        
                        metadata, and we have created our own schema for this data.  One can find this here:

                        We have created a linked social network of Syriac saints and their stories, joining
                        
                        the persons commemorated in Syriac tradition with the lives that described them, the 
                        
                        communities and locations that venerated them, and the manuscript traditions that 
                        
                        preserved and transmitted them. Entries in the database have been issued Uniform 
                        
                        Resource Identifiers (URIs) so that other libraries or databases can interact with our data 
                        
                        and link their databases to ours.  Such sharing and open-access is vital to our project.    
                        
                        We have created our own URIs based on the best practices developed by New York

                        In order to solve the issue of search and display, syriaca.org has used 
                        
                        eXist-db.  Members of the Syriaca.org research and editing team, Nathan Gibson, 
                        
                        Winona Salesky, and David Michelson, have recently expounded on the utility of 
                        
                        eXist-db at a symposium on Cultural Heritage Markup given by the <em>Balisage 
                        
                        Series on Markup Technologies</em>:

                            eXist-db provides a native XML database, for storing, processing and 
                            
                            searching our TEI files. eXist-db provides a number of configurable 
                            
                            indexing methods for searching XML documents, including a full text 
                            
                            search backed by the Apache Lucene search framework. An advantage to 
                            
                            using Lucene for full text searching is the level of control it can give to the 
                            
                            developer through a wide variety of available text analyzers. Lucene also 
                            
                            allows for the creation of custom analyzers as needed, as well as 
                            
                            customizable weighting of elements in the index. In eXist-db multiple 
                            
                            analyzers may be defined and used with different indexes.<span class="footnote-refs">

                        We hope that Syriaca.org’s databases will make contributions both to the study of
                        
                        Christianity in Late Antiquity as well as Syriac Studies more broadly defined.  There is at 
                        
                        present no digital or print tool that brings together so many different aspects of Syriac 
                        
                        saints and hagiography in one place, with free and open access.   We anticipate that this 
                        
                        will be a helpful pedagogical tool for teachers to show students (through visualizations) 
                        
                        the networks among ancient peoples and places in the Syriac world, many of whom were 
                        
                        connected by real or imagined lineages delineated in hagiographic texts.

                    <h2>
                        Concluding Remarks
                    </h2>
                    <p>
                        It has become a commonplace for scholars in Syriac studies to note how much 
                        
                        work in our field remains to be done.  Research <em>desiderata</em> range from historical
                        
                        investigations to raw philological and text critical work on unpublished or unedited texts.
                        
                        Translations of these edited works into modern languages will help scholars to integrate 
                        
                        Syriac material into their research and courses. As syriacist Sebastian Brock noted in 
                        
                        2008, hagiographic material remains a ‘little tapped’ resource (Brock, 2008b).   
                        
                        Syriaca.org’s <em>Gateway to the Syriac Saints</em> will provide a research tool for scholars and 
                        
                        students to see at a glance what work remains to be done to advance our field.  Indeed, 
                        
                        data in the <em>BHSE</em> suggests that approximately 500 hagiographic texts on saints have 
                        
                        never even been edited.  Of those that have been edited, many have not been translated 
                        
                        into a modern language.  Thus Syriac scholars interested in hagiography need not suffer 
                        
                        from a lack of new material to explore. Because our database will be “community-built,” 
                        
                        editors and users will be able to make suggestions, corrections, and updates pertaining to 
                        
                        our data on an on-going basis, ensuring “quality control.”
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Finally, we would be remiss if we were not to mention the relevance of our
                        
                        database for the preservation of the Syriac heritage, whose modern-day descendants, 
                        
                        churches, and artifacts face on-going risks of persecution or destruction on account of 
                        
                        wars in the Middle East and aggression against Christians.  Groups like ISIS are harming 
                        
                        and driving people out of areas (like Northern Iraq) that are important centers for 
                        
                        Syriac–speaking Christianity.  The artifacts of the modern Syriac churches, both literary 
                        
                        and architectural, are under tremendous threat of destruction.  Syriaca.org, therefore, has 
                        
                        a further obligation, as we see it, to use the work, scholarship and technology behind our 
                        
                        database to preserve the endangered heritage of the Syriac Christians.

                        <i>Gateway to the Syriac Saints</i> is a two-part electronic publication that aims to advance the study of the saints in the Syriac tradition. <i>Gateway to the Syriac Saints</i> includes entries on saints indigenous to the Syriac tradition and also on saints from other linguistic regions (Greek, Latin, etc.) whose lives were translated into Syriac or whose cults diffused to Syriac-speaking areas.</p>
                    <p>The West and East Syriac churches have an extensive collection of stories and homilies on the saints, and they are contained in different manuscript collections and editions throughout the world. <i>Gateway to the Syriac Saints</i> aims to make prosopographic and bibliographic information on both the saints themselves and on the literary and hagiographical traditions of the saints available to scholars and students.</p>
                    <p>To this end, Syriaca.org is creating two databases: <i>Part I: Qadishe</i> on the persons or the saints themselves and <i>Part II: Bibliotheca Hagiographica Syriaca Electronica</i> or <i>BHSE</i> on hymns, homilies, and lives of Syriac saints.</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            <i>Part I: Qadishe</i> contains information on persons relevant to the study of Syriac hagiography include the saints themselves (such as St. Simeon the Stylite) as well as their associates and the authors who narrated their lives or wrote homilies and hymns about them. Persons in the database can be annotated with relationships to other people and texts, and link with other <i>Syriaca.org</i> resources, such as the descriptions of places, manuscripts, or bibliography items. <i>Qadishe</i> is organized according to the name of the saint, in English, French, and Syriac. It lists known dates associated with the saint (birth, <i>floruit</i>, death). It also lists relationships between the saint and other ancient persons. Finally, it contains geographical information on locations associated with the saint (birthplace, floruit place, place of death, place of relics, place of veneration). Qadishe takes as its starting point the standard reference on Syriac saints, J.-M. Fiey's <i>Saints syriaques</i> (Princeton, 2004) but also cites other major references including the <i>BHO</i>, <i>GEDSH</i>, and the <i>BSO</i>. <p>
                                <i>Qadishe</i> is also the first volume to be published in <i>Syriaca.org's </i>

                            <i>Part II: Bibliotheca Hagiographica Syriaca Electronica</i> describes texts written about saints and includes information about different versions and data such as the title, prologue, and epilogue of the saint's life, along with the hagiographer. The database notes if there are ancient or modern translations of the texts, the critical edition of the text, the MSS containing the Vita, and relevant secondary literature. This reference work is derived from the earlier <i>Bibliotheca Hagiographica Syriaca</i> (<i>BHS</i>) project that was created by Fr. Ugo Zanetti and Dr. Claude Detienne but never published. <p>
                                <i>Bibliotheca Hagiographica Syriaca Electronica</i> is also the first volume to be published in <i>Syriaca.org's</i>
