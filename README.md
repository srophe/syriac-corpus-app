### Setting up Github webhooks
Syrica.org uses Github webhooks [https://developer.github.com/webhooks/] to keep the remote application upto date with the github repository.
* Requires the EXPath Crypto library to verify Github submissions. [http://exist-db.org:8098/exist/apps/public-repo/packages/expath-crypto-exist-lib.html]
* Requires a config file added to the app home directory. Do not store this file in your github repository. 
  Example:
    
    ```
    <config>
        <!-- Configuration for Github webhooks sync feature -->
        <git-config>
            <!-- github secret key can be stored here or as a environment variable. (prefered)  -->
            <private-key/>
            <private-key-variable>VARIABLE_NAME</private-key-variable>
            <!-- github token for rate limiting. can be stored here or as a environment variable. (prefered)  -->
            <gitToken/>
            <gitToken-variable/>
            <!-- Branch to sync, if empty assumes master -->
            <github-branch>master</github-branch>
            <!-- Collection in eXistdb to sync app to. example: /db/apps/srophe -->
            <exist-collection>/db/apps/srophe</exist-collection>
            <!-- App root in git repository. example: srophe-app -->
            <repo-name>srophe-app</repo-name>
        </git-config>
