            <p>Sources cited in the Syriac Reference Portal frequently give approximate or estimated
            dates in a variety of prose formats. In order to enable these approximate dates to be
            processed as machine-readable data, contributors should translate approximate prose dates into
            ranges with numeric values which reflect the level of precision in the source
            document.</p>
            <p>In general the following prose conventions will be encoded into numeric values according to the following guidelines:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Xth century -- use an 100-year range</li>
                <li>X-Yth centuries -- use an 100-year range for each century</li>
                <li>first/second half of Xth century -- use a 50-year range</li>
                <li>early/late Xth century -- use a 50-year range</li>
                <li>mid-Xth century -- use a 50-year range</li>
                <li>first/last quarter of Xth century -- use a 25-year range</li>
                <li>beginning of Xth century -- use a 25-year range at the beginning of the century plus
                an additional 15-year margin into the previous</li>
                <li>end of Xth century -- use a 25-year range at the end of the century plus an
                additional 15-year margin into the next</li>
            </ul>
            <p>These numeric values may be combined as in the following cases:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Early to mid Xth Century -- use a 75-year range</li>
                <li>late Xth century to early Yth century -- use a 100-year range across two
                centuries</li>
                <li>late Xth century to first quarter of Yth century -- use a 50-year range at the end
                of the century plus an additional 25-year margin into the next</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                <em>NOTE:</em> The ranges corresponding to approximate dates are not mutually exclusive (e.g. early overlaps with mid), nor should they be, since they are by nature not precise information. Accordingly, we have choosen round numbers to begin and end ranges, e.g. 0400-0450 and 0450-0500. The overlap is intended to reflect the imprecision of "first half of the fifth century" which a human author may not intend to end precisely in 0449.</p>
            <h3>
                <i>Circa</i>, ?, <i>Floruit</i>, etc.</h3>
            <p>For dates whose ambiguity has been emphasized by the use of “<i>circa</i>”,
            “?”, or similar wording, contributors should add additional margins of 15, 25, or 50
            years to the dates (contributors may use their discretion in proportion to the size of the date ranges and the uncertainty of the date). Thus “<i>circa</i> Xth century” would be rendered as an 200 year range with 50-year margins on either side of the century in question. <i>Floruit</i> dates should be considered in this same class of highly ambiguous dates. Accordingly a <i>floruit</i> date of “<i>fl.</i> Xth century” should be rendered as an 200-year range, even though the subject is not likely to have flourished for 200 years. Given the highly ambiguous nature of dates in ancient and medieval sources, our editorial preference is to avoid creating a level of precision not supported by the sources.</p>
            <h3>Exceptions for Precise Dates</h3>
            <p>These guidelines do not apply when a more precise range for a date is known (e.g. between years x and y).  In such a case, these specific years should be used instead of the above ranges.</p>
            <p>In general, approximate dates will be encoded into TEI using the @not-before and @not-after attributes (which corresponds to <i>terminus ante/post quem</i>). In cases where specific dates are known or where a choice of date is more appropriate than a range, the @when attribute and multiple &lt;date&gt; elements may be used.</p>
