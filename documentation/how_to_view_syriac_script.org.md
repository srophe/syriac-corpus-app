For the web button or pop up please use one of the following:

* "No Syriac?"
* "Need Syriac Fonts?"(DM's Preferred)
* "No Syriac Characters?"
* "Where is the Syriac?"
* "Got Syriac?"
* "Syriac Display Issues"
* "Syriac Trouble?" (TAC's preferred)
* "Don't see Syriac?"

This pop up should display on every `/place/` page if the user is on Mac OS, iOS, Android or Linux, of if the user is using Windows IE as a browser on Windows.  It should also appear on the `geo/browse.html` because of the Syriac headwords in the place names.

#How to View Syriac Text on Syriaca.org   

If you cannot see Syriac text in this box, your device is not displaying Syriac properly:
		
		Test: ܫܠܡܐ
This problem is commonly due to one of the following causes:

* incompatible web browser
* lack of [unicode](http://www.unicode.org/standard/WhatIsUnicode.html) fonts
* incompatible operating system

##Recommended Web Browsers

Syriaca.org is best viewed using either the [Firefox](http://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/new/) or [Chrome](www.google.com/chrome‎) browsers. Please try Syriaca.org in one of these recommended browsers to see if your problem persists before proceeding to the solutions below.

##Installing Fonts and OS Compatibility

* Mac OS
	
	Common Solution: Install [fonts](http://www.bethmardutho.org/index.php/resources/fonts.html)
	
	If you cannot view Syriac characters you likely need to install a unicode Syriac font (the Mac OS does not come with any Syriac fonts). Syriaca.org recommends you install the Meltho family of Fonts available free from [Beth Mardutho](http://www.bethmardutho.org/index.php/resources/fonts.html). We recommend you install at least Estrangelo Edessa, though you may wish to install all the fonts. 

		Note: Mac users may get an installation error because the Meltho fonts were originally designed for Windows. Please follow this protocol:
		
		1. Open each individual font icon in the Meltho Folder.
		2. Once the "Font Book" window opens, select "Install Font."
		3. A message will display, "Problems may have been found with some fonts during validation. Please review the reported problem before continuing…. One minor problem was found. Proceed with caution."
		4. Check the box "Select all fonts."
		5. Select "Install checked."
		
		Even with Meltho or other fonts installed there is also a known conflict with Apple's default rendering of the ܘ (waw) character when a conflicting Arabic font is installed.	
	
* Windows
	
	Common Solution: Install [fonts](http://www.bethmardutho.org/index.php/resources/fonts.html)
	
	Most versions of Windows come with Estrangelo Edessa preinstalled. If you would like to see Syriac text in other scripts (Serto or East Syriac), we recommend you install the Meltho family of Fonts available free from [Beth Mardutho](http://www.bethmardutho.org/index.php/resources/fonts.html). 

* iOS
	
	Common Solution: Syriac unavailable.
	
	Unfortunately at this time Apple does not support Syriac unicode display on any iOS devices (such as the iPad or iPhone). Prospective users are encouraged to submit a feature request to Apple for "full unicode font support for world heritage languages including Syriac (U+0700–074F)." Apple is soliciting input [here](http://www.apple.com/feedback/ipad.html).
	
* Android
	
	Common Solution: Syriac unavailable.

	Unfortunately at this time Android devices do not support Syriac unicode display without first being "rooted" which is recommended only for advanced users. Prospective users could submit a feature request to Google (or other Android providers) for "full unicode font support for world heritage languages including Syriac (U+0700–074F)." We are not aware of the best way to contact the Android development community at this time.

* Linux
	
	Common Solution: Install [fonts](http://www.bethmardutho.org/index.php/resources/fonts.html)
	
	Syriac can be supported on some distributions of the Linux operating system. If you cannot view Syriac characters you likely need to install a unicode Syriac font.  Syriaca.org recommends you install the Meltho family of Fonts available free from [Beth Mardutho](http://www.bethmardutho.org/index.php/resources/fonts.html). Notes: We recommend you install at least Estrangelo Edessa, though you may wish to install all the fonts.
