#Understanding the Design of Syriaca.org 
***Abstract**: [Syriaca.org: The Syriac Reference Portal](http://http://syriaca.org) is a online research tool whose methodological approach is informed by the emerging field of [digital humanities](http://digitalhumanities.org:8080/dhq/vol/3/1/index.html). As such, it differs in design from traditional print reference works. The primary purpose of Syriaca.org is to serve as an online hub which aids researchers by linking together print and online resources for the study of Syriac culture. Syriaca.org does not intend to be, **per se**, an exhaustive reference document. Instead it's function is to allow the discovery of new connections between primary data and scholarship in the field.*

----

[Syriaca.org: The Syriac Reference Portal](http://http://syriaca.org) is a collaborative online research tool for the study of Syriac literature and culture. It is intended to serve the needs of a broad audience including Syriac specialists, scholars in all fields, cultural heritage communities, and the interested public. Because it serves such a wide community of users, Syriaca.org's primary aim is to serve as an online hub providing users with links to a variety of print and online resources. The linked data structure of Syriaca.org is designed to facilitate the discovery of new connections between primary data and existing scholarship in the field.

Syriaca.org provides four basic services to its users:

* an online search tool for discovering links between existing print and digital resources
* a core index structure ("authority file") which is used to create the system of links
* new reference works for defining entities included in the Syriaca.org index of Syriac studies
* common digital standards to enable scholars to publish their own Syriac scholarship online and link it to Syriaca.org

The methodological approach of Syriaca.org is informed by the emerging field of [digital humanities](http://digitalhumanities.org:8080/dhq/vol/3/1/index.html). Because Syriaca.org relies on new ways to organize information, it differs in design from previous print reference works in the humanities. Namely the chief aim of Syriaca.org is to link together existing resources, rather than to be itself a comprehensive or canonical authority on factual data. In this regard, Syriaca.org is more similar to a Google Search result algorith than it is to an encyclopedia entry.

  * Places, e.g., Edessa
  * Manuscripts, e.g., British Library Manuscript Add. 14,451
