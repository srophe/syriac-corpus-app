                    <em>Qadishe: A digital catalogue of saints in the Syriac Tradition</em>
                </h1>
                <p>
                    <em>Qadishe</em>, or “saints” in Syriac, is a digital catalogue of saints or holy persons

                    venerated in the Syriac tradition.  Some saints are native to the Syriac-speaking milieu,

                    whereas others come from other linguistic or cultural traditions.  Through the translation

                    of their hagiographies and the diffusion of saints’ cults in the late antique world, saints

                    were adopted, “imported,” and appropriated into Syriac religious memory.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Each individual saint listed in <em>Qadishe</em> has his or her own entry.  <em>Qadishe</em> contains

                    biographical and historical information about these persons.  Saints are listed by name

                    and arranged alphabetically in English and Syriac.  Entries are tagged according to

                    hagiographic topoi and motifs.  In this volume, we have included any persons venerated

                    in the Syriac tradition, and we have not distinguished between “historically verified”

                    persons and “fictive” persons.  Our starting point for collecting data was J. M. Fiey’s

                    <em>Saints syriaques</em>, which has 470 entries.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Under each individual entry, we have listed the saint’s name in Syriac and Roman

                    transliterated script, as well as English and French.  We have also written a brief abstract

                    about the person.  We included primary and secondary literature on him or her, as well as

                    his or her birth, death, or <em>floruit</em> dates when known.  We identify and list persons

                    associated with the saint.  Information on the saint is searchable by the person’s name or

                    by the era in which he or she lived.  We have also linked any references to place names

                    associated with this person to <em>The Syriac Gazetteer</em>, a geographic database within

                    Syriaca.org listing settlements and locations relevant to the Syriac world. Some of the

                    saints in <em>Qadishe</em> are native to the Syriac tradition, whereas others were “imported” into

                    Syriac from other linguistic traditions, including Greek.  If they have been granted a religious

                    commemoration (whether in text or liturgy) in the Syriac heritage, they are

                    included in <em>Qadishe</em>.  <em>Qadishe</em> includes saints whose lives have been edited, minor saints

                    referenced in the lives of other saints, and saints who receive commemoration in

                    liturgical calendars.  The names of those saints whose lives have not yet been edited are

                    included in <em>Qadishe</em>, but the descriptions describing these persons are not yet developed.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <em>Qadishe</em> shows scholars how hagiographic literature contains fertile areas in

                    which to discover connections (sometimes fictive) between saints themselves or the

                    communities and monasteries they symbolized.  Hagiographers created relationships

                    among saints to promote their communities’ prestige, antiquity, and orthodoxy.  It is

                    precisely this interconnected nature of Syriac hagiography that makes it so amenable to

                    TEI encoding and linked data.

Persons in the database can be annotated with relationships to other people and texts, and link with other <i>Syriaca.org</i> resources, such as the descriptions of places, manuscripts, or bibliography items. <i>Qadishe</i> is organized according to the name of the saint, in English, French, and Syriac. It lists known dates associated with the saint (birth, <i>floruit</i>, death). It also lists relationships between the saint and other ancient persons. Finally, it contains geographical information on locations associated with the saint (birthplace, floruit place, place of death, place of relics, place of veneration). Qadishe takes as its starting point the standard reference on Syriac saints, J.-M. Fiey's <i>Saints syriaques</i> (Princeton, 2004) but also cites other major references including the <i>BHO</i>, <i>GEDSH</i>, and the <i>BSO</i>.</p>
