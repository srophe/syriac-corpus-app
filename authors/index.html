                <h2>The Syriac Biographical Dictionary (SBD), Volume II</h2>
                <p>Editors: David A. Michelson and Nathan P. Gibson, Vanderbilt University</p>
                <h2>Introduction:</h2>
                <p class="indent">by David A. Michelson</p>
                <p>
                    <em>A Guide to Syriac Authors</em> is a literary reference work documenting authors
                    relevant to the study of Syriac literature. This guide is designed as an aid for
                    both historical research and cataloguing. The entries in the guide are written to
                    help researchers identify and disambiguate authors related to the history of Syriac
                    literature. This author list can be browsed or searched based on numerous criteria
                    including chronology, geography, and relationships between persons and texts. <em>A
                        Guide to Syriac Authors</em> is also designed to meet the pressing need for a
                    name authority file for use by librarians in cataloguing Syriac manuscripts, texts,
                    and published works.</p>
                <p>Each individual entry in <em>A Guide to Syriac Authors</em> corresponds to one person
                    who can be identified as an author. These entries are also included in Syriaca.org's
                    larger database of persons, <a href="../persons/index.html">
                        <em>The Syriac
                            Biographical Dictionary (SBD)</em>
                    </a>, so that researchers interested in
                    prosopography more broadly will have access to the same entries. The sole criteria
                    for inclusion of a particular author in <em>A Guide to Syriac Authors</em> is
                    relevance to the study of Syriac literature. "Relevant authors" include not only
                    persons who wrote in the classical Syriac language or modern Neo-Aramaic dialects,
                    but also a broader range of authors (ancient and modern) whose works have been
                    translated into Syriac or otherwise influenced Syriac literature. For example,
                    relevant entries have also been made for authors who did not write in Syriac but who
                    are named or cited in Syriac texts. Entries have also been created for authors in
                    dialogue with Syriac literature who wrote in the many languages neighboring the
                    Syriac traditions (Arabic, Armenian, Malayalam, etc). There are no temporal or
                    spatial boundaries for the database, which collects data on authors from any period
                    past or present useful for Syriac studies, from authors credited in Syriac biblical
                    translations to members of the contemporary diaspora communities. Similarly,
                    historicity is not a selection criteria, thus <em>A Guide to Syriac Authors</em>
                    includes entries on pseudonymous, uncertain, anonymous, or collective authors when
                    they are of significance for research on Syriac culture. In all cases, inclusion of
                    an author is based on the collection of sufficient citation information to uniquely
                    distinguish each identity. All authors with entries in <em>A Guide to Syriac
                        Authors</em> can be annotated to show their relationships to persons, places, or
                    other data published by Syriaca.org such as in <a href="../geo/index.html">
                        <em>The
                            Syriac Gazetteer</em>
                    </a>.</p>
                <p>As a sub-collection within a larger reference work, <a href="../persons/index.html">
                    <em>The Syriac Biographical Dictionary (SBD)</em>
                </a>, <em>A Guide to
                    Syriac Authors</em> was designed with the same information structure. All
                    entries must include at least one specific primary or secondary source citation
                    sufficient to identify and disambiguate the person. Most entries also contain name
                    variant information. When possible some entries contain greater biographical detail
                    although such detail is not the foremost goal of the publication. The overarching
                    purpose is to provide a unique identifier (a <a href="http://syriaca.org/exist/apps/srophe/documentation/terms.html#uri">URI</a>, uniform resource identifier) for each Syriac author to facilitate
                    cataloguing of Syriac literary works and the creation of linked data in which author
                    URIs will enable linking not only between Syriaca.org's <em>Guide to Syriac
                        Authors</em> and its forthcoming <em>New Handbook of Syriac Literature</em> but
                    also to external partner projects such as the manuscript catalogues of <a href="http://www.mss-syriaques.org/">e-ktobe (Manuscrits syriaques)</a>, <a href="http://www.hmml.org/">the Hill Museum and Manuscript Library</a>, and <a href="http://www.bl.uk/collection-guides/christian-middle-east-collections">The
                        British Library</a>. These person URIs take the form
                    <code>http://syriaca.org/person/\d+</code> (where "\d+" indicates a unique
                    string of one or more numerals). As an example,
                    <code>http://syriaca.org/person/13</code> represents the noted Syriac author and
                    saint: <a href="http://syriaca.org/person/13">Ephrem the Syrian</a>.</p>
                <p>All entries from this reference work are encoded following the guidelines of the <a href="http://www.tei-c.org/index.xml">Text Encoding Initiative (TEI)</a>, a best
                    practice used widely in digital scholarship on literary corpora. In addition, the
                    person records of <em>A Guide to Syriac Authors</em> are also serialized into other
                    data formats for use by other projects. For example entries are exported as MADS
                    records and included in OCLCâ€™s <a href="http://viaf.org/viaf/search?query=local.names+all+%22ephrem%22+and+local.sources+any+%22srp%22&amp;sortKeys=holdingscount">
