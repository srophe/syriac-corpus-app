                <h2>Corrections to Texts Already in the Corpus</h2>
                <p class="indent">Many of the texts in the Digital Syriac Corpus are "Unedited Transcriptions" (see documentation page for Status of Texts), which means that they may contain typographical errors. We invite anyone who finds such errors to inform the editorial board using the "Corrections" button, which can be found in the top-right corner of any text (above the "About This Digital Text" box).</p>
                <p>For further information on proofreading and editing texts in the Digital Syriac Corpus, please see the "Ways to Contribute" documentation page.</p>
                <h2>Contributing New Texts</h2>
                <p>We welcome new additions to the Digital Syriac Corpus. There are two types of submission: Transcribed Texts and Born Digital Editions</p>
                <h3>Transcribed Texts</h3>
                <p>A transcribed text is simply a digital version of a text, generally typed in a word-processor document (.doc, .docx, .txt., .rtf, etc.). If you have any Syriac transcribed in digital format, we would be happy to include that text in the Digital Syriac Corpus and credit you as the transcriber. Additionally, if you are interested, you are welcome to use schemas provided by the Digital Syriac Corpus to convert your transcribed text into TEI/XML format, for which you would also receive credit.</p>
                <p>For further information on submitting transcribed texts to be included in the Digital Syriac Corpus, please see the "Ways to Contribute" documentation page.</p>
                <h3>Born Digital Editions</h3>
                <p>We invite scholars of Syriac who have learned, or who are interested in learning, best practices for creatinng digital editions of texts in TEI/XML format to submit new critical editions of Syriac texts to be included in the Digital Syriac Corpus. All submissions for new editions will be peer-reviewed, and the submitter(s) will be credited as the editor of the text, just like they would be in a print edition.</p>   
                <p>There is one example of a born digital edition already in the Corpus, which will provide the basic template for new submissions: <a href="https://syriaccorpus.org/372.html">The Exhortation of Peter</a>.</p>
                <p>For further information on submitting born digital exitions to be included in the Digital Syriac Corpus, please see the "Proposal Guidelines" documentation page.</p>
